# responsivedemo

Plugin test to display a demo showing responsive design. 

To use, we just have to link js file to our project and creat a new object Respdemo. We need to pass as a parameter the element where we are going to attach the demo. This is something like:


var a = Respdemo('#aqui');

Due to the demo nature, there are certain resolutions where demo will not work. IN that case, it will show a customized error message.
